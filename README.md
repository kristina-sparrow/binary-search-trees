# Binary Search Tree

An implementation of a binary search tree data structure written in JavaScript.

### Features

`BinaryTree(array)` returns a balanced binary search tree (BST) with numerous methods available for use. These include:

- `insertValue(value)` adds a new node containing the given value
- `deleteValue(value)` deletes the node containing the given value
- `levelOrder()` traverses the tree in breadth-first level order
- `inOrder()` traverses the tree in inorder depth-first order
- `preOrder()` traverses the tree in preorder depth-first order
- `postOrder()` traverses the tree in postorder depth-first order
- `height(node)` returns the height of the given node
- `depth(node)` returns the depth of the given node
- `isBalanced()` checks if the tree is balanced
- `reBalance()` rebalances an unbalanced tree

Module includes a simple `driver()` script which will initialize a new tree of random numbers and display its various methods.
